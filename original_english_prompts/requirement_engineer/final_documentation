Application Type: Node.js console application
Application Summary: This application is an intelligent RPA designed to automate the process of booking train tickets on https://www.12306.cn/index/. It utilizes TypeScript and Puppeteer for web interactions, and integrates with a Large Language Model (LLM) to intelligently navigate and interact with web pages based on the current URL and the application's objective. The application dynamically requests user inputs throughout the booking process and uses this information, along with intelligent reasoning, to automate the booking task without manual identification of webpage elements.

Frameworks and Libraries:
- Node.js: Runtime environment for executing the application.
- TypeScript: Programming language for developing the application, offering type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- Puppeteer: Library for automating web browser interactions, essential for navigating web pages and simulating user actions.
- LLM Integration (Specific LLM library/framework to be determined): For intelligent reasoning about webpage elements and automation logic based on the application's goal and the current URL.

Functional Requirements:
1. **Initialization**: The application should initialize a Puppeteer browser session and navigate to https://www.12306.cn/index/ to start the booking process.
2. **Intelligent Automation**:
   - Utilize LLM to interpret the current webpage and determine the necessary actions to progress the booking process based on specified goals (e.g., booking a train ticket for a specific date and destination).
   - Dynamically request and incorporate user inputs (e.g., travel dates, origin and destination, class of service) at appropriate stages of the booking process.
3. **User Authentication**: Prompt the user for authentication details when required during the booking process, ensuring secure handling of these inputs.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Detect and handle web interaction errors, such as navigation issues, element detection failures, or booking constraints.
   - Report errors clearly on the command line, providing users with understandable feedback on the nature of the issue.
5. **Completion**: Upon successful booking, confirm the outcome to the user via the command line, including any relevant details of the booking (e.g., booking reference, train details).

Non-Functional Requirements:
- The application prioritizes functional correctness and user interaction clarity, with specific performance, scalability, and maintainability considerations to be inherently supported by the chosen technology stack and development practices.




You are a requirements engineer tasked with preparing comprehensive and implementation-ready functional requirements for the  project.

**Context**:
The project is segmented into an application summary and a functional requirements list. The application summary offers a high-level project view, while the functional requirements detail the specific functionalities needed. The objective is to refine these functional requirements to an extent that provides developers with the clarity and detail required for immediate implementation, ensuring no further clarification is needed.
